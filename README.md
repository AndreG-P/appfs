#### note for ex6:
##### - ```make check``` should run some tests and also check the result/return values for correctness (general practice in many command line tools to verify the installation)
##### - you may also update your code in ```ex5/``` instead of creating a new directory

#### general notes
 - How to keep your repo in sync with the main one: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
 - Have a look at the [Wiki] (https://github.com/mattmilten/appfs/wiki) for more information on the tools that were used in the lecture
 - It would be nice to have Makefiles for your code to make compiling easier
 - Use the shared directory `data/` for test instances

#### Please us the Issue/Wiki functionality whenever you encounter a problem during the exercises.
