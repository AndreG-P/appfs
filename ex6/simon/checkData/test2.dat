3 #rows
3 #cols
1 2 3 <= 3
1 2 3 <= 2
-4 3 -5 <= 5
#Solution:
#Skipping the following constraint, since it is always feasible, and decreasing the number of constraints by 1: '-4 3 -5 <= 5' 
#Reading successful! Starting enumeration now.
#Preprocessing deleted 1 of 2 constraints.
#Binary assignment 000 is valid!
#Binary assignment 100 is valid!
#Binary assignment 010 is valid!
#3 feasible solutions found!
