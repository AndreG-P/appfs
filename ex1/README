Design choices:

1. Sort or Bitmap ?
   Bitmap:
     - only works for ints up to 31 bit
     - is a little slower for small numbers of ints
     - highly specialized, no choice regarding dublicates or negatives
     + is faster for larger numbers of ints
     + takes less space for larger numbers of ints

2. How to read the input
   direct read
   buffered fread
   memory mapped

3. Store data in static buffer or allocate storage on the heap?
